The aim of our project was to make it easier to explore agricultural open data and thereby increase public engagement with the data themselves and with the open data project generally.

We downloaded the most relevant of the more than 100 databases stored under the  Agriculture, Fisheries, Forestry and Food section. Although in the data.gov.ie site many of the databases are only stored as .json or .px files, we found most of them are available as downloadable csv which are easier to study.

We divided the databases into categories depending on the data stored; livestock, crops, fish and economic data (land values, employment rates, etc.). After that we started with the data sets with only one dimension as these represented the simplest cases to explore.  With enough time we would add the other databases, so that we could also include, for example, the geographical dimensions, until all datasets were included in the application.
